          <p>
  Hi, I'm [Your Name], a final year engineering student passionate about web development. I specialize in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and am always eager to solve complex problems.
</p>
<p className="text-lg mb-4">
  I enjoy creating full-stack web applications, and I have worked on several personal projects such as V-Ideas, a platform for showcasing student projects, and Autostart, a car showroom management system. I aim to continue improving my skills and contribute to meaningful projects.
</p>
<p className="text-lg mb-6">
  One of my other projects, Hostel Bank, is designed for splitting and managing day-to-day transactions among hostel mates. It helps users keep track of shared expenses and simplifies financial management. I love exploring new technologies and am always excited about the future of tech.
